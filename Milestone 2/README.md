# Milestone 2: Design the Benchmark and Evaluation

* **Estimated Duration**: 4 weeks
* **FTE**: 0.375
* **Costs**: US$3,750
* **Estimated Delivery Date**: 7th Jan 2024

**Deliverables and Specifications:**

0b. **Documentation**:
   * Develop a thorough document detailing the benchmarking and evaluation methodology.
   * Present the criteria deduced from Milestone 1 research for benchmarking, with the rationale for each criterion.
   * Describe the techniques adopted for evaluating each framework, focusing on transparency and reproducibility.

0c. **Benchmarking Guide**:
   * Craft a guide that describes how to run the benchmarks, including the necessary software prerequisites and configurations.
   * Present guidelines for interpreting the results, concentrating on areas like:
     * Proving & verification times
     * Proof sizes
     * Comparative performance across varied use cases
     * Support for hardware acceleration
     * Cost factors (e.g., gas/fee) when integrating into blockchain platforms

1. **Functionality: Extracting Benchmark Criteria**:
   * Review findings from Milestone 1 to distill essential benchmarking criteria.
   * Identify key performance indicators, features, or attributes that distinguish each framework. 
   * Determine which of these can be standardized across all frameworks for a balanced comparison.

2. **Functionality: zkML-specific Benchmarks**:
   * Devise specific benchmark tests that:
     * Evaluate performance implications linked with different ML model sizes.
     * Measure inference accuracy loss in zkML frameworks.
     * Understand computational and memory overheads when converting ML models.
     * Test framework compatibility with prevalent ML toolchains or libraries.
   * Design scenarios and use cases that reflect real-world applications and challenges, ensuring a balanced and comprehensive evaluation.

3. **Evaluation**:
   * Implement the benchmarking tests on the chosen zkML frameworks.
   * Gather, scrutinize, and interpret the results to furnish a holistic comparative analysis.
   * Spotlight strengths, limitations, and unique features of each zkML framework as per the benchmarks.
   * Deliver insights and recommendations based on the evaluations to assist developers in selecting the best-fit zkML framework for their projects.
