* Estimated Duration: 6 weeks
* FTE: 0.375
* Costs: US$5,625
* Estimated delivery date: 10th December 2023

**Deliverables and Specifications:**

0b. **Documentation**:
   * Draft a well-structured document detailing our research and survey process.
   * Summarize each selected framework's environment setup.
   * Record the basic test results for each.
   * Highlight the pros and cons of each framework.

0c. **Testing Guide**:
   * Enumerate the methodologies used to test each framework.
